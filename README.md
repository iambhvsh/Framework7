# Framework7s Kitchen Sink Template

## Overview

The Framework7s Kitchen Sink template is a standalone web application designed to emulate the look and feel of native Android and iOS apps. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this template uses core JS components to offer a seamless user experience without requiring any server-side processing. The application includes routing to provide a native-like navigation experience and features the ability to switch between iOS and Android modes as well as dark and light themes.
